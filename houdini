#I am trying to write a name generator for guests for our Houdini show. I believe the following code works, but now I have to figure out how to integrate it with an actual website.

female = [ "Wilhelmina" , "Beatrice" , "Marie" , "Ruth" , "Dorothy" , "Cecilia" , "Daisy" , "Lila" , "Fay" ,
"Sadie" , "Norma" , "Jane" ]

male = [ "Gary" , "John" , "Theodore" , "Edward" , "Frank" , "Arthur" , "Fletcher" , "Martin", "George", "Victor", "Jack" , "Leo" ]

last = ["Mansfield" , "Sweeney" , "Sylver" , "St. Claire" , "Parker" , "Butler", "Gilmore", "London", "Lee", "White" , "Mulholland" , "Valentine" , "Beck" , "Ford" , "Doyle" , "Weiss" , "O’Connor" , "Hinson" , "Rahner" , "Hardeen" , "Kavanaugh" , "Dietrich" , "Devine" ]

job = ["magician and member of the Society of American Magicians" , "spirit guide" , "medium" , "spiritualist" ,
"charlatan" , "scientist" , "author" , "mystery writer" , "poet" , "actor/actress" , "singer" , "musician" , "member of a vaudeville act" , "psychic" , "newspaper reporter" , "magazine editor" , "aviator" , "member of the Scientific American committee" , "science fiction writer" , "illusionist" , "magician’s assistant" , "starlet" , "makeup artist" , "gossip columnist" , "socialite" ]


print "Would you like a male or female first name?"
user_input = gets.chomp
user_input.downcase!

if user_input.include? "female"
  my_first = female.sample
  my_last = last.sample
  my_job = job.sample
  puts "Your name is #{my_first} #{my_last}, and you are a #{my_job}."
else user_input.include? "male"
  my_first = male.sample
  my_last = last.sample
  my_job = job.sample
  puts "Your name is #{my_first} #{my_last}, and you are a #{my_job}."
end

#still figuring this out
